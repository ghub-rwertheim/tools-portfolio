## Projects

### 1. [LLM Debate Arena](./llm-journey/)
Watch two AI models debate any topic with custom system prompts. Useful for exploring different reasoning approaches, testing prompt engineering techniques, and comparing model behaviors.

**Key Features:**
- Custom system prompts for each model
- Multi-round debates (1-8 rounds)
- Real-time streaming responses
- Dual provider support (Groq + OpenAI)

**Use Cases:**
- Testing prompt effectiveness
- Exploring model biases and reasoning patterns
- Generating diverse perspectives on complex topics
- Educational demonstrations of LLM capabilities


---

## Coming Soon

Future experiments planned for this folder:
- **Multi-Model Consensus** - Multiple LLMs vote on answers with confidence scoring
- **Prompt Chain Debugger** - Visualize and debug complex prompt chains
- **LLM-Assisted Code Review** - Automated code analysis with multiple model perspectives
- **Context Window Optimizer** - Smart context management for long conversations

---

## Setup

All projects in this folder share common dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- API keys for LLM providers (Groq, OpenAI, etc.)

---

## Project Status

These are **experimental tools** built to explore LLM capabilities and practical applications. They demonstrate:
- Multi-provider LLM integration
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Real-time streaming implementations
- Input validation and security practices

**Note:** These projects prioritize experimentation and learning over production-grade reliability.

---

## Technologies Used

- **LLM APIs:** OpenAI, Groq, (Anthropic planned)
- **UI Framework:** Gradio
- **Python Libraries:** `openai`, `python-dotenv`, `gradio`
- **Security:** Input validation, prompt injection protection
